# Unreal Engine Live Project

# Introduction
  During my course at the Tech Academy, I created a game in Unreal Engine 5. I was tasked to create any type of game of my choosing and utilize the blueprint features to build it from the ground up. During the project, my class would meet for daily stand-ups and weekly code retrospectives that kept us accountable while also helping us manage our projects. We utilized version control to manage our games as changes and updates were made daily to the game. this project allowed me to work on several game developers' aspects such as UX/UI, game mechanics, game/level design, and Unreal blueprinting. I was able to create a short but challenging 2D platformer in which the player is challenged to get through levels by avoiding hazards while picking up gems for score and health to stay alive.

  During the 2-week sprint, I learned how to work in Unreal, learned many steps that it takes to create a game from the ground up, and several other skills that I will be able to utilize in future projects.

  I will include snippets of blueprints I created to create various game mechanics as well as outlines for my game design 

# Unreal Engine Blueprints
  Each game mechanic and character movement is brought to life with Unreal Engine's Blueprints which is a scripting system that creates gameplay elements.

# Skills Acquired
- Working with Unreal Engine blueprints
- Game Design
- Using Azure DevOps to handle version control for the game
- Creating Win/Lose Mechanics including environmental hazards
- Creating a multi-level game with cohesive maps
- Debugging games and solving problems
- Utilizing Game Instances
- Using Widgets to display menus and in-game UI

# Game Levels Overviews

Created three levels for FoxRun with increasingly difficult platforming and hazards. I wanted the player to also feel like they were on an adventure from their house in the meadows to the dark forest leading into the cave where the source of the dangerous plant growth was coming from.

To create my levels in Unreal using 2D assets I utilized the tile map tools to be able to freely design each level using tile sets made from the 2D assets.

Level 1 - The Meadows

Level 2 - The Dark Forest/ Cave Entrance

Level 3 - The Source of the Growth

# The Player

The player character was also made using 2D assets and animation was created by using the flipbook tool in Unreal Engine. This helped me create animations for running, jumping, and idle. The player also had a health and death/respawn mechanic associated with them.
