<p>This project was completed during the Tech Academy two-week Live Project</p>
<p>Working in Unreal Engine 5 I was able to create a 2D platformer. In the game, your character races against the clock to avoid environmental hazards, collect gems to increase your score and collect hearts to stay alive. I built the entire game except assets from the ground up. Utilizing Unreal blueprints I was able to create a 2D world and moving character using pixel assets. The game consists of the main menu/win/loss screens as well as 3 levels that I designed myself.</p>

<p>Through this project I was able to learn how to create UX/UI, character movement in the 2D plane, score/time systems, as well as health/respawn mechanics.</p>
