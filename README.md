# Unreal Engine Live Project

# Introduction
  During my course at the Tech Academy, I created a game in Unreal Engine 5. I was tasked to create any type of game of my choosing and utilize the blueprint features to build it from the ground up. During the project, my class would meet for daily stand-ups and weekly code retrospectives that kept us accountable while also helping us manage our projects. We utilized version control to manage our games as changes and updates were made daily to the game. this project allowed me to work on several game developers' aspects such as UX/UI, game mechanics, game/level design, and Unreal blueprinting. I was able to create a short but challenging 2D platformer in which the player is challenged to get through levels by avoiding hazards while picking up gems for score and health to stay alive.

  During the 2-week sprint, I learned how to work in Unreal, learned many steps that it takes to create a game from the ground up, and several other skills that I will be able to utilize in future projects.

  I will include snippets of blueprints I created to create various game mechanics as well as outlines for my game design
